# Learn2
## Created with CodeSandbox

Learn2 is a platform that helps you learn two languages **(german and english)** at the same time, the trick is a **mnemonic technique** that consisting of:

1. To Select a place, a object or a person that remind us the country.
2. To Choose the word that we want to learn.
3. The next step is place us in our country remind (place, object, person, any...) and think the word that we select to remind us and invent a very detailed little story about that word. For example, to me, a Spanish speaker the word **calendar** reminds me like **calentar (to warm)**. With this I´ll image that I´m front Mr. Trump and I´m making a torch with his calendar and he is  very furious, his orange face happens to be tomato red and I can imagine how his face sweats.

With this in mind we can learn all the language in many many minus minutes. Obviously we need to practice and be consistent to learn the languages.
